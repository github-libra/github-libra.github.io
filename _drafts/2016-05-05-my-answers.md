[InterviewThis](https://github.com/ChiperSoft/InterviewThis) is an open source list of developer questions to ask prospective employers during the hiring process. As a practice and conclusion for me, I try to answer some of these questions.

## Development Process

### What will be my day to day responsibilities? How much time do you anticipate I would spend on each one?


### What source control do you use? Can you explain why you chose it?

### What is your workflow currently, with regards to developers pushing changes. Do you do pull requests, or does everyone just merge to a central repo?

### Are you using a ticket system or is it more play it by ear? Do you use the same system for both bugs and new features?

### Do you have a code review process?

### Does your team encourage the use of SOLID and DRY design principles to avoid cyclomatic complexity?

### Do you have established code style rules?

### What are your development environments like?
